# Challenges faced 

The Project Brief did not mention anything about adding anything to the menu list, therefore I was suprised to see nothing been displayed on my menu, even thou I was sure that I followed every instruction when coding. I finally figured it out that I can't have an instruction to Calculate and update the total price while i did not add the price to list.
